Chess Commentator
========================

This application will be used to allow chess players to comment on one another's games. Games will be submitted as PGN files (or played onto a Javascript chess board on the site) and saved in a user's library (tagged by tournament, opponent, etc -- will have full search capability). Engine analysis will *not* be implemented, choosing rather to focus on human interaction and comments.

Players will be able to suggest other variations as comments, with each top-level comment or variation creating a message thread for discussion. Comments can be moderated by either the player (if an adult) or the coach (if the player is a child), preventing abuse.

Features Intended for First Release
-----------------------------------

1. User logins, as either an adult or a child (child accounts require an adult coach account to moderate comments). Coaches can also input games under the child's library. 
2. Game libraries for each user, with standard PGN tags. Search may or may not be implemented in first release.
3. Top-level comments for the games (commenting on moves or variations will come in later releases).
4. Accounts have personal info (USCF ID, online chess handles, etc, plus relevant links) but that info can be hidden except from coaches. Games are always publicly viewable.
